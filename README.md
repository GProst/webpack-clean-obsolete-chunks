A webpack plugin to remove obsolete chunk files in webpack watch mode. 
Especially useful when use hashes in output file names.

## Installation

```
npm install webpack-clean-obsolete-chunks --save-dev
```

## Usage

Just add this plugin as usual.

``` javascript
// webpack.config.js
var CleanObsoleteChunks = require('webpack-clean-obsolete-chunks');

module.exports = {
    // ...
    plugins: [
        new CleanObsoleteChunks()
    ]
    // ...
};
```

## How it works

Plugin searches for all updated chunks and deletes obsolete files in output directory after each 
webpack compilation.
